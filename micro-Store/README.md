# Real-Time Microservices Project with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

Welcome to the Real-Time Microservices Project repository! This repository contains the source code and resources for a real-time microservices project implemented using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud technologies.

## Project Overview

In this project, I am learning how to create a real-time microservices architecture using the following technologies:

- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud
- Netflix Eureka for service discovery
- Spring Cloud Gateway for API gateway
- Keycloak for security
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth
- Event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka
- Docker for containerization
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring microservices


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Refer to each section's documentation to set up and run the corresponding part of the project.

Feel free to explore the source code and customize it to your needs.
